Working of the Automatic Light System
System Initialization

The VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Board sets up the LED and IR sensor pins.
The IR sensor is continuously monitored for motion detection.
Motion Detection

When the IR sensor detects motion, it triggers the LED to blink three times (ON for 300ms, OFF for 300ms).
After three blinks, the LED remains ON, indicating detected movement.
No Motion Condition

If no movement is detected, the LED stays ON by default, ensuring continuous illumination.
Automation and Efficiency

The system automatically controls lighting without the need for manual operation.
This enhances security, energy efficiency, and convenience for smart home and security applications.
